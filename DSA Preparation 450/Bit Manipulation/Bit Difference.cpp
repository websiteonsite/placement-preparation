Expected Time Complexity: O(log N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 â‰¤ A, B â‰¤ 106

Example 1:

Input: A = 10, B = 20
Output: 4
Explanation:
A  = 01010
B  = 10100
As we can see, the bits of A that need 
to be flipped are 01010. If we flip 
these bits, we get 10100, which is B.
Example 2:

Input: A = 20, B = 25
Output: 3
Explanation:
A  = 10100
B  = 11001
As we can see, the bits of A that need 
to be flipped are 10100. If we flip 
these bits, we get 11001, which is B.




int countBitsFlip(int a, int b){
    int count=0;
    int c=a^b;
    while(c)
    {
      c = c&(c-1);      
      count++;
    }
//     11110 = c
//     11101 = c-1
//     c = c&(c-1);
//     step -> 1
//     c = 11100
//     c-1 = 11011
//     step -> 2
//     c = 11000
//     c-1 = 10111
//     step -> 3
//     c = 10000
//     c-1 = 01111
//     step -> 4
//     c = 00000
//     that means -> a^b == 0 -> a and b are equal.
  
    
    return count;
